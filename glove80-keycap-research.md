# Glove80 Keycap Research

## Requirements

- Black keycaps with a small transparent/shine-through part (dot or bar, not full legends)
- Homing bump keycaps for F and J keys (tactile/haptic feedback)
- High quality
- Must ship to Germany

## Glove80 Keycap Compatibility

The Glove80 uses **Kailh Choc v1 (low-profile) switches** with **Choc spacing (18x17mm)**.

Any replacement keycaps must be:

1. **Choc v1 stem** compatible (two small rectangular pins, NOT MX cross stems)
2. **Choc-spaced** (18x17mm, NOT MX-spaced 19.05mm) — MX-spaced keycaps will collide on the Glove80
3. The Glove80 needs **80 keys total** (including thumb clusters)

### Keycap Profiles

| Profile | Description | Glove80 Fit |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **MCC** (MoErgo) | Stock Glove80 caps. Cylindrical, smooth row-to-row sliding. Best for thumb keys. | Perfect (designed for it) |
| **MBK** (FKcaps) | Most popular aftermarket Choc keycap. Flatter with slight edge ridge. | Compatible, slight feel difference on thumb cluster |
| **CFX** (Chosfox) | PBT/PC, slightly smaller 1U footprint than MBK. | Compatible, different aesthetics |
| **DES** | Boutique/specialized. Some are MX-spaced — check carefully. | Verify spacing before buying |

## Best Match: "MBK Dot Glow" / "Shine Through Icon - Dots"

Black Choc v1 keycaps with a small shine-through dot or bar (not full legends). The Glove80's per-key RGB shines through the tiny transparent window.

Material: ABS with PU coating or polycarbonate (PC) for the transparent parts.
